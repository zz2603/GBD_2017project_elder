## Deaths

### Number 

We tried to separate the table of death number into a few parts: gender-specific, age-specific, age-gender-specific, total age and gender death number. 

We created a new age group variable for subjects with 10-59 and 60+ years old.   

```{r deathnum}
# age-specific death number
country_age_specific_dth_num <- country %>% 
  filter(measure=="Deaths" & metric=="Number" & sex=="Both") %>%
  select(-cause) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = c("year","sex","age","measure","metric"),
              values_from = c("val","upper","lower")) %>% 
  arrange(location) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

# create a tbl for 10-59 and 60 plus
country_age_specific_dth_num_elder <- country %>% 
  mutate(age_elder = if_else(age %in% c("10 to 14",
                                        "15 to 19",
                                        "20 to 24",

### Rate

We will do same thing on the suicide rate.

However, unlike suicide number, when we calculated rate for those subjects with 10-59 and 60+ years, gender-specific rate, and total suicide rate, we cannot directly sum up every group of age-specific rate. We need to use the age-specifc rate and age-specific number to calculate the total population among age groups.

```{r dthrate}
# age-specific death rate 
country_age_specific_dth_rate <- country %>% 
  select(-cause) %>% 
  filter(measure=="Deaths" & metric=="Rate" & sex=="Both") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = c("year","sex","age","measure","metric"),

We create a new variable for standard population weight
